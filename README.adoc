= Ansible playbook for turning a PC into a set of core service VMs

Ansible helps me build my home lab. 
This playbook turns a PC running RHEL 9 into a hypervisor running a pile-load (that's the technical term) of Virtual Machines. 
Each VM runs a set of services that support my home lab. 

. *gateway* hosts Bind and Squid
. *ipsal* (Internet Protocol Services, Application Level) hosts DHCPd and NTPd
. *id* hosts Red Hat IDM (LDAP, CA, DNS)
. *message* hosts Postfix
. *monitor* hosts Prometheus, Grafana, and Elastic
. *git* hosts Gitlab

Under construction. Sections marked with !!! and ??? are notes to self. 

If you can read Ansible's YAML, start with   
https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-lab/blob/main/main.yml[main.yml]. 

This playbook relies on a bunch (that's another technical term) of collections, including my https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-collection-platform[ansible-collection-platform].
Check out requirements.yml, described below.


==  requirements 

Various roles and collections. 
See the cheatsheet below. 



== the KVM/QEMU hypervisor 

A bootstrap shell script kicks off the install. 
See instructions in 
https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-lab/blob/main/machine-hypervisor.sh[machine-hypervisor.sh]

The https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-lab/blob/main/group_vars/all/main.yml[defaults file] defines a lot of values. 
For instance, most 
MAC addresses are set to ** 52:54:00:02:00:* **,  and 
IPv4 addresses are set to ** 192.168.135.* **.

== cheat sheet

=== PC and OS

Start with a machine running RHEL 9. 
A fresh minimal install is fine. 

Only tested on a box with one ethernet interface, plugged into the network.


=== install dependencies

Script 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-lab/main/machine-hypervisor.sh[machine-hypervisor.sh] 
sets up everything on a freshly installed host. 
This works with RHEL and Fedora. 
Some things, like that "dnf install" line, won't work on other OSs.

* Log into the hypervisor machine.
* Download the script.

[source,shell]
....
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-lab/main/machine-hypervisor.sh 
....

* Read the script and follow the instructions.


The script creates a new user named _ansible_user_
along with a key pair named _ansible-key.priv_ and _ansible-key.pub_ 
and sudoers privilege escalation.
The playbook uses _ansible_user_ to connect to all the machines, 

The script also clones the playbook repo and installs dependencies. 



=== add Red Hat Subscription account to the vault

Each new VM will connect to the RHSM (Red Hat Subscription Management) network,
register, attach a subscription entitlement, and download from 
Red Hat's CDN (Content Delivery Network).

* Sign up for free at https://developers.redhat.com/.
* Check your account works by logging in at https://access.redhat.com/.
* Edit the vault file.
* Enter your Red Hat Subscription Manager account.
* Encrypt the file.

[source,shell]
....
vim vault-credentials.yml
echo 'my vault password' >  ~/my-vault-pass
ansible-vault encrypt --vault-pass-file ~/my-vault-pass vault-credentials.yml  
....


=== edit inventory

Set up these hosts in the inventory. 

*  install_host - where the playbook runs. Might be your workstation, or might be the hypervisor host, or might be another machine in your lab.  
*  hypervisor - the physical machine that hosts the virtual machines. 


=== run, the AAP1 way

Build the network and machines.

[source,shell]
....
ansible-playbook  --vault-pass-file ~/my-vault-pass  main.yml
....

Or override your RHSM values. 

!!!  now auto-attach instead of   --extra-var="rhsm_pool_id=my_pool_id"

[source,shell]
....
sudo ansible-playbook main.yml \
    --extra-var="rhsm_user=my_user"  \
    --extra-var='rhsm_password=my_password' 
....

Or build just one machine and change a few details. 

[source,shell]
....
sudo ansible-playbook machine-dhcp.yml \
    --extra-var="host=another-name"  \
	  --extra-var="disk_size=40"   \
	  --extra-var="if1_mac=52:54:00:12:34:56"
....

Or install RHEL 8, not 9.

[source,shell]
....
sudo ansible-playbook machine-id.yml  \
    --extra-var="os_variant=rhel8.5"  \
    --extra-var="install_iso=/var/lib/libvirt/images/rhel-8.6-x86_64-dvd.iso"
....


=== run, the AAP2 way

Create

required?
  --playbook-artifact-enable=false \

[source,shell]
....
ansible-navigator run main.yml \
  --become-password-file=~/my-pass \
  --mode=stdout \
  --eei hub1.lab.example.com/my_new_ee  \
  --extra-var='rhsm_user=RH_user'  \
  --extra-var='rhsm_password=RH_password' \
  --extra-var='rhsm_pool_id=12345'  
....


=== check the VM console 

The OS takes a couple minutes to install on a new VM. 
You can't see much from the playbook output - each playbook exits when the build starts.

Use virsh to see what's happening.

[source,shell]
....
sudo virsh list -all
sudo virsh console gateway.lab.example.com
....

A fresh kickstart install takes about 5 minutes, then the VM is powered down. 

If you want to login to the console, two accounts are configured. 

* user: root, password: Password;1
* user: nick, password: Password;1
