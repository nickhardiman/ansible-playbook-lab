# Build the virtual machine hardware, install OS, and install apps.

# !!! firewall port opening 
# !!! gone walkies 
# eg. 
# git.lab.example.com requires firewall-cmd --add-service https --permanent


# prerequisites 
# git, the hypervisor, Ansible user, image storage and virtual network.
# A bootstrap shell script sets these up.
# See instructions in the README and machine-hypervisor.sh

#
# Each of these playbooks can be run separately. 
# For machines that need to register with RHSM, use a vault file.
#   ansible-playbook --vault-pass-file=~/my-vault-pass  machine-repo.yml
# For machines that use local repos, there is no need to register.
#   ansible-playbook  machine-git.yml
#
# Work around some chicken-and-egg problems. 
# * No DHCP yet, so the first two machines have static IP addresses.
# * No DNS yet, so use /etc/hosts records. 
# * No local RPM repositories yet, so the first four update from RHSM CDN 
# Use an account for RPM package downloads from 
# RHSM CDN (Red Hat Subscription Management Content Delivery Network). 
# Work around some access problems.
# * No NAT, so use the gateway proxy.
# * The install host does not use the new network's DNS. 
#   Add /etc/hosts records so the install host can find all these machines.
#
# Gateway has a unique architecture. 
# It is the only host with an interface on the public network and 
# a second interface on the lab network.
# It runs squid to proxy web requests to the Internet, and 
# bind to proxy DNS requests to the Internet.
